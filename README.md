# Connect4

A connect 4 game, where you go against an AI model using a Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning


The game is played on a 6 row by 7 column grid suspended vertically. On each turn, a player drops one piece into any column that is not already full. The piece drops down the column until it reaches the bottom or lands on top of another piece. Once placed, pieces are never moved. The â€€first player to place four pieces in a row|horizontally, vertically, or diagonally is the winner. If the board fills without either player making a row of four, the game is declared a draw.
